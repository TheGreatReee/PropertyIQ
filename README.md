```

## PostgreSQL Setup

- Download and install both pgAdmin and PostgreSQL.

Install Postgres without changing anything, except entering of master **password**.

Open the SQL shell by entering ```psql``` in your Windows search menu.

Inside SQL shell, keep pressing enter until it prompts you for your **password** which you created during the installation. Type your password here even though it doesn't look like it is being keyed in. Press enter once done.

It should look like...
```
Server [localhost]:
Database [postgres]:
Port [5432]:
Username [postgres]:
Password for user postgres:

postgres=# 
```

Install pgAdmin , enter the password from psql and you should then see the following...

Click on server database icon top left and add the password which you entered in psql.

Follow the below commands in the PSQL shell.
```
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE propertyIQ OWNER postgres;
//To create the database of propertyiq
postgres=# \l 
//To list the databases 
```
Finally, go to pgAdmin, and refresh the page.

Note: Should you need to uninstall/re-install you will need to manually delete the folder where you have installed Postgres and pgadmin. This is even after uninstalling from system settings. For some reason, Postgres folder's don't remove entirely even though you select the option.

## Super-user for Django-admin
```python manage.py createsuperuser```

Type your password here even though it doesn't look like it is being keyed in. Press enter once done.

Username: propertyIQ    
Password: sc2006_1234

## Testing URA API 
- To save all the data of the properties, uncomment Line 54 - 57 of views.py in property app. 
- After that, comment it back as those lines will run everytime you try to make migrations / migrate / runserver.
- Run it once, and check the database for the updated records.
- If you ever want to delete the records from the database for some reason , do the following:

```
python manage.py shell
from property.models import Property
Property.objects.all().delete()
```

- If you want to drop the whole database but cannot do so via PGADMIN:

Open the SQL shell by entering ```psql``` in your Windows search menu.

Inside SQL shell, keep pressing enter until it prompts you for your **password** which you created during the installation. Type your password here even though it doesn't look like it is being keyed in. Press enter once done.

It should look like...
```
Server [localhost]:
Database [postgres]:
Port [5432]:
Username [postgres]:
Password for user postgres:

postgres=# 
```

RUN THESE COMMANDS and change the database name appropriately to your own database name. This should work.
```
update pg_database set datallowconn = 'false' where datname = 'propertyiq';
select pg_terminate_backend(pg_stat_activity.pid) from pg_stat_activity where pg_stat_activity.datname = 'propertyiq';
drop database propertyiq;
```
